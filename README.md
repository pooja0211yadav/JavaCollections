**Collections** 
Collections refer to a framework that provides architecture to store and manipulate a group of objects. This framework includes:

-Interfaces (e.g., List, Set, Queue, Map)
-Classes (e.g., ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, HashMap )
-Algorithms to perform operations like searching, sorting, etc.


**ðŸ”¹ Common Collection Interfaces and Implementations**
Interface              	Implementation Classes                 	Description
List	                  ArrayList, LinkedList                 	Ordered collection, allows duplicates
Set	                    HashSet, TreeSet	                      Unordered (or sorted), no duplicates
Queue	                  PriorityQueue, LinkedList	              FIFO structure
Map	                    HashMap, TreeMap	                      Key-value pairs, keys are unique
